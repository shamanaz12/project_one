              I am Shama Naz. My body is my own. I have worked on the issue of
              child abuse, and based on my experiences, I can say that even
              today, there is a dire need to address this issue. Whether the
              area is backward or advanced, awareness and efforts to protect
              children are still lacking. People often feel helpless when it
              comes to saving children. Please, do not ignore the injustices
              happening to children around you. Take steps to stop such
              oppression. May God bless everyone.
