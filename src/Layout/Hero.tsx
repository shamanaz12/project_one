                    self-esteem, and difficulty in forming healthy
                    relationships. In severe cases, childhood trauma can lead to

                <h1>Blog: Ending the Cycle of Child Abuse: A Call to Action</h1>
                <p>
                  Child abuse is a deep-seated issue that continues to devastate
                  millions of children across the globe. Despite the progress
                  made in raising awareness, the problem persists, and the cycle
                  must be broken. The first step in ending child abuse is
                  education. Parents, teachers, and caregivers need to
                  understand the signs of abuseâ€”physical, emotional, sexual, and
                  neglect. Being able to recognize the early indicators can lead
                  to timely intervention, preventing further harm to the child.
                  Schools and communities must foster environments where
                  children are taught their rights and know that they have
                  someone to turn to when they feel unsafe.
